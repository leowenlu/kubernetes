## Installing the client tools

We will use `worksation` as the worksation where we use to manage our K8s, so first of all we will get it setup.

* To make sure ssh scp work to all the other nodes, like masters and workers, we will generate a rsa key pair, then copy the pub key over to all the nodes.
* Get the hash from all the nodes, and append to know_hosts in `worksation`, so when we do scp it will not popup at very first scp.

### generate rsa cert pair

set the vagrant root folder

VAGRANT_FOLDER=/YOURFOLDER/vagrant

Navigate vagrant folder, generate private key in `workstation` then copy the public key over to masters, workers nd the loadbalancer.

Generate a key pair in `workstation`, and copy workstation public cert to all nodes.

``` bash
cd $VAGRANT_FOLDER
vagrant -c "ssh-keygen -t rsa -N '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa <<< y" worksation
PUB_CERT=$(vagrant ssh -c "cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" workstation)
for vm in workstation master-1 master-2 worker-1 worker-2 loadbalancer
  do
    echo "Copying pub key to ${vm}"
    vagrant ssh -c "echo ${PUB_CERT} >> /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys" $vm
  done

```

copy vm key to workstation's ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```
for vm in workstation master-1 master-2 worker-1 worker-2 worker-3 loadbalancer
  do
    echo "Copying known_hosts to workstation "
      vagrant ssh -c "ssh-keyscan ${vm} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts" workstation
  done
```
## install kubectl to the workstation

The [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl). command line utility is used to interact with the Kubernetes API Server. Download and install `kubectl` from the official release binaries:

Reference: [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)


```
vagrant ssh workstation
```

```
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.20.0/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/

```

YOU CAN RUN THE SCRIPT ON THE vagrant working folder.
